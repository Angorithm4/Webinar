## Understanding the High-Level Programming Languages
A high-level programming language defines a **programming abstraction**:<br>
The Programmer expresses an algorithm using the language, and the compiler must translate that program to the target language.
**Generally, high-level programming languages are easier to program in, bust are less efficient, that is, the target programs run more slowly.**<br>
**Programmers using a low-level language have more control over a computation and can, in principle, produce more efficient code.**<br>

Unfortunately, lower-level programs are harder to write and -- worse still -- less portable, more prone to errors, and harder to maintain.<br>
Optimizing compilers include techniques to improve the performance of generated code, thus offsetting the inefficiency introduced by high-level abstractions.
